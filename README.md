# Lineate
A small website for finding the best mathematical model for certain data points.

## What does it do?
It finds the line of best fit.

Oh, you want the technicals? Well, it finds the regression model with the lowest amount of error using R^2 analysis.

## Why Lineate?
Finding the best models for data sets can be a grueling and time-heavy process. Unless you're a data scientist or math person, you don't see the fun in finding a regression model. Lineate makes your life easier by automating the whole process and telling you how good the proposed models actually come out to be.

## How can I help?
I don't know too much about data science, and this project is here to help me learn about it. So, if you want to make corrections to the code or tell me about an error in my math, please submit a pull request or email me.
